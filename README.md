## Project Overview

`skelogen` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that simplifies project setup and management. It automates the creation of standard project structures, essential configuration files, and initial documentation, ensuring consistency and speeding up developer onboarding across various projects.

### Why skelogen?

In today's fast-paced development, consistency and quick setup are crucial. `skelogen` tackles common issues like project boilerplate, inconsistent configurations, and varied documentation. It offers a clear way to define project templates, ensuring every new project or module meets predefined standards from the start. This reduces manual setup errors, lets developers focus on core tasks, and leads to a more maintainable codebase.

### Impact & Benefits
