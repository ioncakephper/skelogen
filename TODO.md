## README Enhancements (Bill Gates Probes)

- **What's New/Why Now? (Unique Selling Proposition):** Add a brief section explaining what problem `skelogen` solves that isn't already solved, or how it solves it better.

- **Impact/Metrics:** Consider adding quantifiable benefits or efficiency gains (e.g., "reduces setup time by X%").

- **Getting Started/Quick Start:** Add a very quick "How to install and run your first `skelogen` command" or a dedicated "Installation/Usage" section.

## Package and Repository Discoverability

- **`package.json` keywords:** Create or update the `keywords` section in `package.json` to increase the package's visibility on npmjs.

- **GitHub Repository "About" section:** Create and update the "About" section (description) of the GitHub repository to increase discoverability. Limit the description to 160 characters (GitHub's current limit). Additionally, create and update the Topics list, limiting to 20 topics (GitHub's current limit).

- **`package.json` description:** Update the `description` property in `package.json` to accurately reflect the package. Limit this description according to best practices and common usage for GitHub and npmjs.
